Linux System folders(ubuntu 20 LTS)

linux uses /(forward slash) instead of \(backward slash) of windows.
~ = to home directory of logged in user.(root/user_name/)
/ = absolute root (containing all folders such as bin boot dev lib var tmp)
FileSystem Hierachy Standard = FHS = maintained by linux foundation.

we should focus on bin, etc, opt and usr. 

bin(binary) = it contains ls, cat like things. which normal user will have access to.(multi user mode or general mode.)
sbin = it contains programs which only system admin have access to.(single user mode)
boot = bootloader inside this folder.
dev (device) = contains all device files, which are not regular files but instead refer to various hardware devices on the system, including hard drives.
etc = system wide configuration
home = personal files and documents.
lib/lib32/lib64/libx32 = binaries required by bin and sbin. libx32 contains more advanced/new features/instruction set.
media = external hard disk/floppies/CD / pendrive
mnt = external network drive such as network filesystem or manually mounted devices.
opt (optional)= manually installed softwares.
proc = Virtual filesystem providing process and kernel information as files.
root = home directory for super(root) user.
run  = tmpfs file system.Files under this directory are removed or truncated at the beginning of the boot process. (It deprecates various legacy locations such as /var/run, /var/lock, /lib/init/rw in otherwise non-ephemeral directory trees as well as /dev/.* and /dev/shm  which are not device files.)
snap = snap applications stored. snap application are self contained packages which runs differently than regular packages.
srv = service data stored here. to store files accessed by external user to run web server or ftp server.
sys (system) = another temporary directory to store system information.
tmp = temporary directory.
usr = user application space
usr/share/src = header files and kernel source.
var = Variable files: files whose content is expected to continually change during normal operation of the system, such as logs, spool files, and temporary e-mail files.
var/log = logs of system and applications.
 
different colors used to denote types of items in directory.
	Uncolored (white): file or non-filename text (e.g. permissions in the output of ls -l)
	Bold blue: directory
	Bold cyan: symbolic or hard link
	Bold green: executable file
	Bold red: archive file
	Bold magenta: image file, video, graphic, etc. or door or socket
	Cyan: audio file
	Yellow with black background: pipe (AKA FIFO)
	Bold yellow with black background: block device or character device
	Bold red with black background: orphan symlink or missing file
	Uncolored with red background: set-user-ID file
	Black with yellow background: set-group-ID file
	Black with red background: file with capability
	White with blue background: sticky directory
	Blue with green background: other-writable directory
	Black with green background: sticky and other-writable directory
	
*.d = Generally when you see that *.d convention, it means "this is a directory holding a bunch of configuration fragments which will be merged together into configuration for some service."

systemd = linux pid 1 process.
