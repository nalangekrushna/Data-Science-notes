KNN
	Best cases
	1) when dimensionality is small(<10)
		problems with large dimensionality
		1)curse of dimensionality when using eucludian distance
		2)interpretability reduces.
		3)runtime complexity of kdtree or LSH increses.
		
	Worst cases
	1) when required low latency system.
		If needed to use kNN then try to use with LSH or kdtree.
