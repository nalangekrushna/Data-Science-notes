Numpy

1D array = vector
2D array = matrix
nD array = tensor

np.arrange(start=0,stop,steps=1) = to create numpy array   dtype = int64
np.linspace(start,end,no of points) = to create numpy array
np.one(shape tuple)   dtype = float64
np.zeros(shape tuple)   dtype = float64
np.eye(shape tuple) = gives diagonal matrix with 1 at diagonal   dtype = int64
np.diag(list of diagonal element values) = diagonal matrix with given diagonal values.    dtype = int64
np.random.rand(no of elements) or np.random.randn( no of elements), np.random.randint
difference in above two is explained in probability part.
when you slice another numpy array from one array it didn't create copy but creates a view for memory optimazation purpose.so when you update a view the original array is also gets updated. To avoid this use copy method to make another copy of an array.
