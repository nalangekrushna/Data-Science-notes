
Notes are IMPORTANT!

Feynman technique = 1) pick and study topic
					2) explain topic to child( unfamiliar person with subject)
					3) indentify any gaps in your understanding.
					4) go back to content to fill the gaps.

spced interval learning = 
	1) after 1 day try to explain concept using feynman techniques.
	2) after 1 week try to solve q and a in applied ai course
	3) after 1 month again use feynman's technique.
	
learning to learn 
	No course in world can teach you everything..
	Image search is great way.
	post comment on video that you don't understand
	you will get email responsed to all questions you posted.
	additional reading report 
	weekly progress reports
	submit assignments in ipynb and pdf format
	take response on whatsapp or email.
	save your work on google drive
	error dubug using just google.
	
most important aspects of data science by order
1) feature engineering
2) Bias-Variance Tradeoff
3) Data analysis and visualization.

Can you explain the difference between ML and DL without using any technical term like features or multilayer neuron?
