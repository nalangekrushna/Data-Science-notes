
Fourier decomposition/transform = popular method for time series data.
amplitude = height of wave from zero.
time period = time taken for one oscillation.
frequency = 1/time period
phase  = distance from x axis when time = 0

fourier transform =  if you have repeating pattern then you can break it into sum of sine wave.
whenever you have repeating pattern in time series frequencies are important.
when you get time series use fourier transform to convert it into frequency domain and then take amplitude and frequency value as features.

image histograms = color histogram, edge histogram
color histogram = image has pixels and every pixel has RGB values and all values go from 0 to 255. color histogram
	cannot recognize shape.
Edge histogram = edge histogram capture angle of edge.

SIFT = scale invariant feature transform = object detection = for any point it creates 128 dimensional vector.
scaling invariance = feature didn't change much if size of image changes.
rotational invariance = feature didn't change much if image is rotated.

Indicator variable  = binary variable answering yes or no

feature binning = to bean the given feature take only that feature and label(y variable) and build a decision tree and use decision tree visualization to bin given feature.

interaction feature = combining two features with any mathematical operation.for every leaf node you can create a interactive feature. combining two features will become two way interaction.

Model specific featurization
	Logistic regression on power law distributed data = apply log function on power law distributed data as it will convert it into gaussian or normal distributed curve on which logistic regression works best.
