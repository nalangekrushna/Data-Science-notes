Linear Regression

Here our objective is to find the line or plane in 3d.thats the geometric intution of it.
there is no need of handing imbalanced data as class labels are not there.

outliers = outliers need to be removed from training data. As we are taking square of loss outliers affect too much.

 
first decide a random value of k.    1<= k <= n(total no of points)
then pick random k points for each iteration.
for x iterations you will reach w = w*
