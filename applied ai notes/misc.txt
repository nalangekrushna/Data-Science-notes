	1) first we predcit y_pred from given data.
	2) then we sort by y_pred in ascending order. it has three columns id,y_pred,y_actual
	3) then we make set of m rows. and calculate average of it.
	4) if y_actual also is in increasing order for average of m rows same as y_pred then our model is sensible.
	5) then we plot graph of y_actual and y_pred. Ideally it should be 45 degree angle from origin.
	
platt calibration = plat calibration works only when calibration plot looks like sigmoid function.

Isotonic calibration = piecewise linear model
	It works well with stepwise curve. but it requires many more points to work.
	
RANSAC = RANdom SAmpling Consensus = 
	1) take random dataset d zero from d train.
	2) build a linear regression model on d zero which is called l zero.
	3) calculate outliers based on model l zero by taking difference between y_pred and y_actual.
	4) that outlier set will be called o zero.
	5) create a new dataset by subtracting o zero from d train which is called d train one.
	6) repeat above procedure to find d train two.
	7) check if both models give same results. if not then continue the procedure.
	8) then finally u get a model l i and l i+1 which is almost same which u can use as training data.
	
VC dimensions(Vapnik chervanes) = measures how powerful the algorithm is.
vc dimension of linear model = maximum no of points that can be shattered by linear regression in all possible configuration = 3 
vc dimension rbf-svm kernel = infinity
theoratically rbf svm is most powerful algorithm. but practically it is not because in theory we make lot of assumptions which are not possible in real world scenario.
