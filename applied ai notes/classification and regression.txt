
if vector type is not given then by default its column vector.

K-NN (nearest neightbour) = 
concept : take k nearest point by distance.and then take their majority vote to estimate point type.
failure case : 1) when the point is too far away from any cluster.
			   2) or when the cluster mixed with different points and there is no seperation between clusters.
			   
distance measurement :
	1) euclidean distance(L2) = shortest distance between two points measured by pythagoras theorem.
	2) manhatten distance(L1) = summation absolute values of all the xi
	3) minkowski distance(Lp) = p the power of difference of two points.
	4) Hamming distance = it is used in nlp. hamming distance is no of points where binary vectors are different.
	5) cosine distance 
	
when cosine distance increase cosine similarity decreases.
cosine similarity = 1 when both points are same. then cosine distance = 0
cosine similarity  = -1  when both points are opposite. then cosine distance = 2
cosine similarity = cos(theta)
cosine distance = 1 - cos(theta)

As k increases decision surface becomes smoother and smoother.
