Logistic Regression(lr) = 

Assumptions = all classes are almost/perfectly linearly seperable.
There is no collinearity or multi collinearity.

lr is prone to outliers.
Imbalanced data needs to be handled.

monotonic function  = if x increases then f(x) also increases.

ways to convert non linear datapoints to linear datapoints.(feature engineering).
1) polynomial function( f1,f1 square,f1 cube)
2) trignometric function (sin cos tan)
3) boolean functions ( and or xor)
4) log or exponential functions.
