why convert text to vector
if we convert text to vector we can use all power of linear algebra there.

token = You get a token by splitting sentence a space.
Word = A token that is not a stop_word
edit distance =  a way of quantifying how dissimilar two strings (e.g., words) are to one another by counting the minimum number of operations required to transform one string into the other. Being the most common metric, the Levenshtein distance is usually what is meant by "edit distance".

text-preprocessing
1) remove stop words
2) convert to lower case
3) stemming
4) lemmitazation
5) uni-gram,bi-gram,n-gram
	in uni-gram each word is considered as dimension. In bi-gram each consecutive pairs of word is considered as dimension.
	
term frequency = no of time the word occured/total no of words
Inverse document frequency = log(total no of documents/no of documents containing given word.)

formula for word value vi = Term frequency * inverse document frequency.

what tf idf does ?
	tf = more importance if word is frequent in document.
	idf = more importance to rarer word in document corpus.
	limitation = doesn't take semantic meaning.
	
word2vec = takes semantic meaning in consideration. works on dense matrix
sparsity of matrix = no of zeroes/total no of values.
