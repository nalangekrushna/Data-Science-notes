why convert text to vector
if we convert text to vector we can use all power of linear algebra there.

text-preprocessing
1) remove stop words
2) convert to lower case
3) stemming
4) lemmitazation
5) uni-gram,bi-gram,n-gram
	in uni-gram each word is considered as dimension. In bi-gram each consecutive pairs of word is considered as dimension.
	
term frequency = no of time the word occured/total no of words
Inverse document frequency = log(total no of documents/no of documents containing given word.)

formula for word value vi = Term frequency * inverse document frequency.

what tf idf does ?
	tf = more importance if word is frequent in document.
	idf = more importance to rarer word in document corpus.
	limitation = doesn't take semantic meaning.
	
word2vec = takes semantic meaning in consideration. works on dense matrix
sparsity of matrix = no of zeroes/total no of values.
