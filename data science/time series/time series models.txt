AR (Auto Regressive) model = A linear model where current period values are sum of past period values multiplied by a numeric factor. It works best with stationary data. In AR models we generally rely on PACF.
AR models are less reliable when estimating non-stationary data.
AR model made good predictions but failed to adjust quickly to unexpected shocks.

X_t = C + fi * X_t-1 + E_t

fi = any numeric constant by which we multiply lagged values. fi < 1 
E_t (epselon at time t) = Residual the difference between our prediction for time t and correct value.
C = constant value.

Log likelihood ratio test(LLR test) = 

to stop adding next lag in model we check for two conditions.
1. non-significant p value for LLR test.
2. non-significant p value for highest lag coef. 

MA (moving average) model = This models adjust very well with unexpected shocks such as recession and earthquakes. Here we rely on ACF. MA models do not perform well on non-stationary data. MA model are great in modelling random walk because they take their mistakes into account.
X_t = C+ theta_1*E_t-1 + E_t

theta_1 = numeric coef of value associated with first lag.

ARMA (Auto regressive Moving average) model = 
MA models smooth out the predictions. Also MA model accounted for residuals.and these need a baseline to perform well. we can use previous values to provide that. Thus if we have model that accounts both past values(AR) and past errors(MA) then it should solve issues each one has individually.

R_t = C + fi_1 * r_t-1 + theta_1 * E_t-1 + E_t

R_t = values in current period
R_t-1 = values in previous period
fi_1 = weightage of values of last period.
theta_1 = weightage of errors of last period.
All the coef must be in range of -1 to 1.

the order parameter in ARMA consist of two orders. order=(AR,MA)

ARIMA(Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average) = (p,d,q) where p =AR q = MA d= Integration
d = no of times we need to integrate the time series to ensure stationarity.
we only rely on integration when our time series don't come from stationary process. if single layer(d=1) accomplishes this then any additional layers are unnecessary.

X_t is our price then
delta_X_t = C + fi * delta_X_t-1 + theta_1*E_t-1 + E_t    for ARIMA(1,1,1)
delta_X_t = price difference in period X_t and X_t-1

ARIMAX model = 
delta_X_t = C + beta * X + fi * delta_X_t-1 + theta_1*E_t-1 + E_t
here X can be any variable which we want to consider in time series.

ARCH model (Auto Regressive conditional heteroskedasticity model)= to measure the volatility.
Heteroscedasticity = different dispersion
conditional = a value that depends upon others.
It has two parts in its equation.
1. mean = C + fi_1 * mu_t-1 + E_t
2. variance (sigma^2) = Vt|Vt-1 = alpha_0 + alpha_1 * E_t-1^2
	Vt|Vt-1 = current values depends upon past one.(conditional variance)
	E_t = equivalent to theta_1
	
Volatility = numeric measurement of uncertainity.

GARCH model = generalized ARCH model = In GARCH model we add previously calculated ARCH model. reason behind this is it is observed that period of low volatility are followed by period of low volatility and vice versa.
