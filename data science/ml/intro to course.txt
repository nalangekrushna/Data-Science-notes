
Notes are IMPORTANT!

Feynman technique = 1) pick and study topic
					2) explain topic to child( unfamiliar person with subject)
					3) indentify any gaps in your understanding.
					4) go back to content to fill the gaps.

spced interval learning = 
	1) after 1 day try to explain concept using feynman techniques.
	2) after 1 week try to solve q and a in applied ai course
	3) after 1 month again use feynman's technique.
	
learning to learn 
	No course in world can teach you everything..
	Image search is great way.
	post comment on video that you don't understand
	you will get email responsed to all questions you posted.
	additional reading report 
	weekly progress reports
	submit assignments in ipynb and pdf format
	take response on whatsapp or email.
	save your work on google drive
	error dubug using just google.
	
most important aspects of data science by order
1) feature engineering
2) Bias-Variance Tradeoff
3) Data analysis and visualization.

Can you explain the difference between ML and DL without using any technical term like features or multilayer neuron?

what is ai ?
abiity  to perform  tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages.

what is ml ?
Machine learning is a subset of AI.
ML is ability of computers to learn without explicitly programming them.
In ml we will give input and output and ML will make model or program that is able to give output next time when we give input.This is called data driven approach.

what is dl ?
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning.
Deep is a technical term. It refers to the number of layers in a neural network.
Deep learning is a class of machine learning algorithms that:[10](pp199â€“200) use multiple layers to progressively extract higher level features from raw input. For example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layer may identify human-meaningful items such as digits/letters or faces.
