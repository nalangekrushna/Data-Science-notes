Formulae

mean/avg = sum of elements/no of elements

median = Median is the middle number in a sorted list of numbers.
median =  (no of values/2)+1 (odd count) position value is median.
	   x = no of values/2
	   y = (no of values/2)+1
median value for even no of values = (x+y)/2

variance(sigma^2) =  (sum of square of (x_i-mean(x)))/ no of x_i
				  = avg((x_i-mean(x)^2)
standard deviation = sqrt(variance)

co-variance = avg((x_i - mean(x)) * (y_i - mean(y)))

Pearson correlation coef = covarince(X,y)/(sigma(x)*sigma(y))

Linear regression
y = a1*x1+c
Here we have given x(features) and y(label). Using below formula we can find out values of m and c.
m = sum((x(i) - mean(x)) * (y(i) - mean(y))) / sum( (x(i) - mean(x))^2 )
c = mean(y) - a1 * mean(x)

R squared
residual sum of squares SS_res = avg((y_i-y_pred_i)^2)
total Sum of squares SS_tot = avg((y_i-y_mean)^2)
R = 1- (SS_res/SS_tot)
