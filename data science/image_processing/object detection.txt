object detection 

Image classification involves assigning a class label to an image, whereas object localization involves drawing a bounding box around one or more objects in an image. Object detection is more challenging and combines these two tasks and draws a bounding box around each object of interest in the image and assigns them a class label. Together, all of these problems are referred to as object recognition.
