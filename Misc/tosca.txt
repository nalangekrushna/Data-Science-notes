Tosca = tosca is software testing tool used to automate end to end testing(functional, regression, api, mobile) for software applications. Tosca combines multiple aspects of software testing such as test case design, test automation, test data design and generation.

Tosca two important techniques
1. Model based testing = tosca creates model of application under test(AUT) instead of scripts for test automations. All technical details of application objects(controls), test script logic and test data are kept seperately and merged at time of test execution.
2. Risk based testing = This feature allows user to assess the risks with respect to test cases and allows them to identify the right set of test scripts to minimize the risks.

tosca features
Model based testing approach
Risk based testing approach
scriptless automation = test case can be developed by drag and drop features of modules and test data parameters etc.
mobile testing
api testing
supports different kind of applications
dynamic test data

tosca components
Tosca commander = commander helps in development, management, execution and analysis of test script creation.
Tosca executor = tosca executor executes test cases developed in tosca. This is an alternative to test exectution without opening tosca commander.
tosca wizard = Its a legacy module used scan applications to create object maps for test automation.
test repository = test cases can be stored in external shared repository or database. Data can be stored there using TDS or TDM (Test Data Management).
