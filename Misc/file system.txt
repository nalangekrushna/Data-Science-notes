File Systems

what is file ?
a file is a contiguous set of bytes used to store data. This data is organized in a specific format and can be anything as simple as a text file or as complicated as a program executable. 
Files on most modern file systems are composed of three main parts:
	Header: metadata about the contents of the file (file name, size, type, and so on)
	Data: contents of the file as written by the creator or editor
	End of file (EOF): special character that indicates the end of the file
	
File Paths : Itâ€™s broken up into three major parts:
	Folder Path: the file folder location on the file system where subsequent folders are separated by a forward slash / (Unix) or backslash \ (Windows)
	File Name: the actual name of the file
	Extension: the end of the file path pre-pended with a period (.) used to indicate the file type
	
Also by default use Unicode(UTF-8) character encoding as ASCII is subset of unicode.


difference between windows and linux/mac ?
windows used CR+LF(\r\n) Carriage Return as line ending. linux uses only LF(\n) Line Feed as end of line.
for EOF (End of File) windows uses 26 while linux uses 4.
