similar project description
Recently I worked on automating S3 bucket uploads using S3 event notification trigger and aws Lambda. So when someone uploads data in first buckets predetermined folder with given extension. A S3 notification trigger will be triggered which will call the lambda function. The lambda function written in Python will get object using key name provided in event parameter to get the object then apply some transform on it and store it in another S3 bucket.

I am also currently working on a complex CI/CD pipeline which involves multiple API calls to third party vendors such as Oxygenxml web author and Ixiasoft CCMS which is an editor and Version Control System for technical writer respectively. It involves logging into Oxygnexml when writer commits technical documentation using Python script, downloading the changes and using another Python script to upload to Ixiasoft CCMS.
