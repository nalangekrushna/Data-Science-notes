Applicatio Load Balancing = ALB is having redundancy in single AZ. AWS Elastic Load Balancer(ELB) ensures High Availability(HA) across multiple Availability Zones(AZs) within a Regional Boundary.
Optionally you can select the Availability Zones where the ELB is placed, which impacts HA (Select multiple AZs for Higher Level of HA). You can also configure for multi-region HA using DNS routing policies to send traffic for multiple ELBs in different regions.

route 53 evaluate target health flag to check health of resources.

subdomain to redirect to new page with domain registered other than amazon
	you don't need to transfer domain for creation of subdomain. create a hosted zone for subdomain. and point dns service for that subdomain to hosted zone.

analytics application = sequential read/write access to very large data sets. Given that the company is a data analytics firm, they should first be provided with the necessary tools that would enable them to perform data analytics at some velocity, such as RedShift and EMR. 

You configured CloudWatch monitoring on an On-Demand, EBS-backed EC2 instance which is deployed on ap-southeast-1 region. Which of the following metrics will always show a value of 0? 
	-> DiskReadOps is the metric that counts the completed read operations from all instance store volumes available to the instance in a specified period of time. To calculate the average I/O operations per second (IOPS) for the period, divide the total operations in the period by the number of seconds in that period.

	If there are no instance store volumes, either the value is 0 or the metric is not reported. Hence, the correct answer is Option 1. The same behaviour also applies with DiskWriteOps, DiskReadBytes and DiskWriteBytes.
