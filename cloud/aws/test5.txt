If you get an InstanceLimitExceeded error when you try to launch a new instance or restart a stopped instance, you have reached the limit on the number of instances that you can launch in a region. When you create your AWS account, AWS sets default limits on the number of instances you can run on a per-region basis. To solve this issue, you can request an instance limit increase on a per-region basis.

To allow a user to pass a role to an AWS service, you must grant the PassRole permission to the user. PassedToService is a condition key used to filters access by the AWS service to which this role is passed. 

when you delete Customer Master Keys (CMKs) associated with KMS
Deleting a customer master key (CMK) in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is destructive and potentially dangerous. It deletes the key material and all metadata associated with the CMK and is irreversible. After a CMK is deleted, you can no longer decrypt the data that was encrypted under that CMK, which means that data becomes unrecoverable. You should delete a CMK only when you are sure that you don't need to use it anymore. If you are not sure, consider disabling the CMK instead of deleting it. You can reenable a disabled CMK if you need to use it again later, but you cannot recover a deleted CMK.

AWS KMS does not rotate the backing keys of CMKs that are pending deletion. A CMK that is pending deletion cannot be used in any cryptographic operation. default CMK delete waiting period is 30 days.

ec2 instances in VPC using aws cli. recently launched EC2 instances do not have public DNS hostnames. reason for the issue ?
Public IPv4 addresses enable communication over the Internet, while private IPv4 addresses enable communication within the network of the instance (either EC2-Classic or a VPC). 
enableDnsHostnames - Indicates whether the instances launched in the VPC get public DNS hostnames. If this attribute is true, instances in the VPC get public DNS hostnames, but only if the enableDnsSupport attribute is also set to true.

enableDnsSupport - Indicates whether the DNS resolution is supported for the VPC. If this attribute is false, the Amazon-provided DNS server in the VPC that resolves public DNS hostnames to IP addresses is not enabled. If this attribute is true, queries to the Amazon provided DNS server at the 169.254.169.253 IP address, or the reserved IP address at the base of the VPC IPv4 network range plus two will succeed.

If both attributes are set to true, the following occurs:
- Your instance receives a public DNS hostname.

- The Amazon-provided DNS server can resolve Amazon-provided private DNS hostnames.

If either or both of the attributes is set to false, the following occurs:
- Your instance does not receive a public DNS hostname that can be viewed in the Amazon EC2 console or described by a command line tool or AWS SDK.
- The Amazon-provided DNS server cannot resolve Amazon-provided private DNS hostnames.
- Your instance receives a custom private DNS hostname if you've specified a custom domain name in your DHCP options set. If you are not using the Amazon-provided DNS server, your custom domain name servers must resolve the hostname as appropriate.

By default, both attributes are set to true in a default VPC or a VPC created by the VPC wizard. By default, only the enableDnsSupport attribute is set to true in a VPC created on the Your VPCs page of the VPC console or using the AWS CLI, API, or an AWS SDK.

Key policies are the primary way to control access to customer master keys (CMKs) in AWS KMS. Although they are not the only way to control access, you cannot control access without them.
