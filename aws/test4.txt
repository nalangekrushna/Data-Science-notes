AWS CloudHSM is a cloud-based hardware security module (HSM) that enables you to easily generate and use your own encryption keys on the AWS Cloud. With CloudHSM, you can manage your own encryption keys. 

KMS does not reside in your VPC, unlike CloudHSM. KMS does not provide dedicated, third-party validated hardware security modules under your exclusive control, unlike CloudHSM. In KMS, the hardware security modules (HSMs) are managed by AWS and not by you.

With step scaling policies, you can specify the number of seconds that it takes for a newly launched instance to warm up. Until its specified warm-up time has expired, an instance is not counted toward the aggregated metrics of the Auto Scaling group. While scaling out, AWS also does not consider instances that are warming up as part of the current capacity of the group.

A stack set lets you create stacks in AWS accounts across regions by using a single AWS CloudFormation template. All the resources included in each stack are defined by the stack set's AWS CloudFormation template. As you create the stack set, you specify the template to use, as well as any parameters and capabilities that the template requires. Hence, using CloudFormation StackSets to update the stacks on multiple AWS accounts is the best answer in this scenario.
Using CloudFormation Stack Instances to define and manage stack instances on multiple AWS accounts is incorrect because a stack instance is simply a reference to a stack in a target account within a region. Remember that a stack instance is associated with one stack set which is why this is just one of the components of CloudFormation StackSets.

The general flow of installing the CloudWatch agent is as follows:
1.Create the IAM roles and users that you need for the CloudWatch agent. They enable CloudWatch to collect metrics from the server, and to integrate with AWS Systems Manager.
2. If you are installing on an Amazon EC2 instance, attach an IAM role to the instance. If you are installing on an on-premises server, create an IAM user to enable the CloudWatch agent to write information to CloudWatch.
3. Download the agent package, using either AWS Systems Manager Run Command or a public Amazon S3 download link.
4. Modify the CloudWatch agent configuration files, and create a named profile for the CloudWatch agent. Creating the named profile is optional when installing the agent on an Amazon EC2 instance.
5. Start the agent, using either Systems Manager Run Command or the command line.

cloudfront RTMP dist = a CloudFront RTMP distribution is primarily used to stream media files using Adobe Media Server and the Adobe Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP). Take note that you cannot invalidate objects that are served by an RTMP distribution.

You can use Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager (Amazon DLM) to automate the creation, retention, and deletion of snapshots taken to back up your Amazon EBS volumes.

InsufficientInstanceCapacity = AWS does not currently have enough available On-Demand capacity to service your request.
