Ephemeral Ports = The ephemeral ports are the short-lived transport protocol ports for Internet Protocol (IP) communications. Ephemeral ports are allocated automatically from a predefined range by the IP stack software. An ephemeral port is typically used by the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), User Datagram Protocol (UDP) or the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) as the port assignment for the client end of a client-server communication to a well-known port on a server. 
What that means is, when a client initiates a request it choose a random port from ephemeral port range and it expects the response at that port only. Take note of the below statement:
When we say that the client initiates an HTTPs or HTTP request it actually means that the destination port is 443 or 80. It is NOT the sender port.
It is the client’s operating system that chooses the sender’s port from the ephemeral port range and this range varies depending on the OS. 
For HTTPS, the outbound rule in our case allows the response at port 443. Now, this doesn’t allow outbound HTTPS traffic because that is not the port from which request was initiated. For the request to succeed we would have to set Outbound Port Range to 1024-65535 and NOT to 443.
As discussed above, the client that initiates the request chooses the ephemeral port range. So in order to allow outbound IPv4 responses to clients, for example serving web pages to people visiting the web servers in the subnet, you need to allow traffic through the ephemeral ports depending on the clients.

aws naming conventions

Api are in Capital case.  e.g.  CreateStack
parameters are in camel case. eg.   stackParam
cli commands and cli parameters are in small case with hyphen  e.g.  create-stack,  --on-failure

kinesis = aws kinesis is real time fully managed and scalable data streaming service which enables real time data analytics. It can be used with video, audio, logs, website clickstreams as well as IoT telemetry data. Kinesis video stream uses TLS encryption for data at transport and aws KMS to encrypt data at rest.

kinesis data firehose = used to store data in desired aws storages such as s3 bucket or aws redshift.

aws support service plans
	aws provide 24*7 access to customer service and documentation to all its customer. Above this there are three plans below.
	developer = business hour email access to cloud support engineer.
	business = 24*7 access by email, chat and call to cloud support engineer.
	enterprise = 24*7 access by email, chat and call to cloud support engineer.
	
	
	
linux halt command = This command in Linux is used to instruct the hardware to stop all the CPU functions. Basically, it reboots or stops the system. If the system is in runlevel 0 or 6 or using the command with –force option, it results in rebooting of the system otherwise it results in shutdown.

linux dd command = convert and copy.
