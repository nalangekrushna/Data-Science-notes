Amazon CloudWatch = monitors the health and status of AWS resources in real time.
Amazon CloudWatch Logs = collects and monitors log files, can set alarms, and automatically reacts to changes in AWS resources.
Amazon CloudWatch Alarms = monitor a single metric and perform one or more actions based on customer-defined criteria. 
Amazon CloudWatch Events = delivers a near real-time stream of system events that describe changes in AWS resources.

AWS CloudTrail = monitors calls made to the Amazon CloudWatch Events Application Programming Interface (API) for an account.

AWS Config = AWS Config provides a detailed view of the configuration of AWS resources in an AWS account, including how the resources are related to one another.

Metrics = At the core of Amazon CloudWatch are metrics , which are time-ordered sets of data points that contain information about the performance of resources.

Amazon CloudWatch collectd plugin = publishing extension for collectd , an open-source statistic gathering daemon. All configured collectd metrics are automatically published to Amazon CloudWatch. 

Data points are not returned from Amazon CloudWatch in chronological order.

Namespaces = A namespace is a container for a collection of Amazon CloudWatch metrics. There are no default namespaces. When creating a custom metric, a namespace is required.

Dimensions = A dimension is a name/value pair that uniquely identifi es a metric and further clarifi es the metric data stored. A metric can have up to 10 dimensions. Think of dimensions as categories or metadata for those characteristics.

If unit is not provided for metrics then amazon cloudwatch uses None as unit. For metrics that are continuously emitted, Amazon CloudWatch sends a notification until three failures are found. When monitoring, using an average value can hide events that are drastically different than normal ones. When monitoring a maximum value, however, a single, random spike can skew the results. To avoid this, monitor the 95th percentile of CPU utilization to check for instances with an unusually heavy load.

Inside Amazon EC2, there are two types of status checks: a system status check and an instance status check.

An Amazon CloudWatch Alarm is always in one of three states: OK , ALARM , or INSUFFICIENT_DATA .
■ When the monitored metric is within the range that has been defined as acceptable, it is in the OK state.
■ When a metric breaches a user-defined threshold, it transitions to the ALARM state.
■ If the data needed to make a decision is missing or incomplete, it is in the INSUFFICIENT_DATA state.
