aws compute 

aws lambda = compute service that runs code without need to provision and manage server.
aws elastic beanstalk = quickly deploy and manage applications on aws cloud without worrying about infrastructure that runs those applications.
EC2 container service = container management service for docker in EC2 instacne.
lightsail = This service is for developers who need virtual private servers. It is readymade template which includes everything to run server running.
Batch = computing workloads on the AWS Cloud.

aws EC2 instance has following features
	Virtual computing environments, known as instances
	Preconfigured templates for your instances, known as AMIs Various configurations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity for your instances, known as instance types
	Secure login information for your instances using key pairs (AWS stores the public key, and you store the private key in a secure place.)
	Storage volumes for temporary data thatâ€™s deleted when you stop or terminate your instance, known as instance store volumes
	Persistent storage volumes for your data using Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS), known as Amazon EBS volumes
	Multiple physical locations for your resources, such as instances and Amazon EBS volumes, known as regions and Availability Zones
	A firewall that enables you to specify the protocols, ports, and source IP ranges that can reach your instances using security groups
	Static IPv4 addresses for dynamic cloud computing that can be assigned to an individual instance, known as Elastic IP addresses
	IPv6 addresses that can also be assigned to instances 
	Virtual networks that you can create that are logically isolated from the rest of the AWS Cloud and that you can optionally connect to your own network, known as Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (Amazon VPCs)
standarad vs convertible reserved instances = You can upgrade or downgrade the instance size of both Standard and Convertible Reserved Instance. However, only the Convertible Reserved instance can change the instance type. Hence, Convertible Reserved Instances is the correct answer.

instance storage = physical storage attached to your instance. you cannot stop only terminate instance store backed ec2 instance. Also it takes more boot time than EBS backed storage. 
EBS(Elastic Block Storage) = logical storage can be extended or reduced.
EFS (Elastic File System)

Although you can only access instance metadata and user data from within the instance itself, the data is not protected by cryptographic methods. Anyone who can access the instance can view its metadata. Therefore, you should take suitable precautions to protect sensitive data (such as long-lived encryption keys). You should not store sensitive data, such as passwords, as user data.

User data is data which you can pass to the instance upon initial boot up or in subsequent boots. User data allows you to specify parameters for configuring your instance or attach a simple script. You can also use this data to build more generic AMIs that can be modified by configuration files supplied at launch time. For example, you can change a basic AWS Linux AMI to become a web server using user data. User data is limited to 16 KB, but you can load larger files by giving links to s3.

Lightsail vs Beanstalk = If you need more flexibility on configuration,go with Elastic Beanstalk. But if you just want to run a simple application in the cloud, Lightsail might suit your need. Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service that manages, deploys, and scales Web App by handling capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling, and application health monitoring. Under the hood, it uses Cloud Formation to provision its resources such as EC2 Instances, Auto Scaling Group, Load Balancers, S3 and optionally AWS Relational Database Service (RDS). Lightsail gives you a pre-configured Virtual Private Server platform with the simplified management console. Lightsail plan comes in a bundle with a fixed amount of RAM, vCPUs, SSD and a free data transfer allowance, with static IP addresses and DNS management.

for docker elastic beanstalk is the only option. beanstalk supports autoscaling while lightsail didn't.

Dedicated Instance = Dedicated Instances are Amazon EC2 instances that run in a virtual private cloud (VPC) on hardware that's dedicated to a single customer. Dedicated Instances that belong to different AWS accounts are physically isolated at a hardware level, even if those accounts are linked to a single payer account. However, Dedicated Instances may share hardware with other instances from the same AWS account that are not Dedicated Instances.
There are no performance, security, or physical differences between Dedicated Instances and instances on Dedicated Hosts. However, there are some differences between the two. 
	Use Dedicated Hosts for more visibility into the physical host for BYOL. You should also try Dedicated Hosts if your app requires minimal latency between instances(where you have per-socket, per-core, or per-VM software licenses.)
	Use Dedicated Instances if you are only concerned with compliance with regulations
	
snapshots = You can back up the data on your Amazon EBS volumes to Amazon S3 by taking point-intime snapshots. Snapshots are incremental backups, which means that only the blocks on the device that have changed after your most recent snapshot are saved.

Monitoring the Status of Your AWS Cloud Services 
aws provides below two ways to do that 
	AWS Service Health Dashboard = With the AWS Service Health Dashboard, you can view current as well as past service health for all services across all regions except china and us gov.you can personalize it to track your AWS Cloud services.
	AWS Personal Health Dashboard = provides information about AWS health events that can affect your account. The information is presented in two ways: a dashboard that shows recent and upcoming events organized by category and a full event log that shows all events from the past 90 days.

Monitoring with Amazon CloudWatch
Amazon CloudWatch monitoring is turned on by default for Amazon EC2 instances. Basic monitoring, which collects metrics every five minutes, is provided by default.

Using AWS CloudTrail = get a history of AWS API calls and related events for your account.

private ip address = it is assigned at instace creation and only removed when instace is terminated. It has no impact on instance reboot and stop.
public and elastic IP address behave differently than private ip address. when instance will stop public ip address will be returned to aws. elastic ip address is kept in same account available for reassignment for particular aws account.

aws instance pricing
on-demand = no upfront commitment, pay as you go.
reserved instance = upfront commitment, discount on on-demand pricing.
spot = bidding for instance when your price exceed bidding amount you get spot instace.

Estimating Costs
two tools for estimating costs
	AWS Simple Monthly Calculator = this is general purpose to calculate your total cost.
	AWS Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator = AWS TCO Calculator allows you to estimate the cost savings when using AWS and provides a detailed set of reports that can be used in executive presentations.
	
AWS Trusted Advisor = recommendations on how to potentially reduce your spending with AWS.
Placement Groups = logical grouping of instances in a single Availability Zone. It is useful when you want to do high performance computing.
AWS Service Catalog = allows IT administrators to create, manage, and distribute portfolios of approved products to end users who can then access the products they need in a personalized portal.

The primary tool used for monitoring your Amazon ECS clusters is Amazon CloudWatch. There is no additional cost for using Amazon ECS. The only charges are for the Amazon EC2 instances or AWS Lambda requests and compute time.
