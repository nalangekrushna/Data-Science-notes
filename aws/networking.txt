Networking

AWS Direct Connect (connection)= allows you to establish dedicated network connection from your premise to AWS VPC.

aws direct connect connection between vpc and on-premise prerequisite
1. Your network must use single-mode fiber with a 1000BASE-LX (1310 nm) transceiver for 1 gigabit Ethernet or a 10GBASE-LR (1310 nm) transceiver for 10 gigabit Ethernet.
2. Auto-negotiation for the port must be disabled. Port speed and full-duplex mode must be configured manually. 
3. 802.1Q VLAN encapsulation must be supported across the entire connection, including intermediate devices.
4. Your device must support Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) and BGP MD5 authentication.

AWS Direct Connect Gateway = You can use an AWS Direct Connect gateway to connect your AWS Direct Connect connection over a private virtual interface to one or more VPCs in your account that are located in the same or different regions. You associate a Direct Connect gateway with the virtual private gateway for the VPC, and then create a private virtual interface for your AWS Direct Connect connection to the Direct Connect gateway. You can attach multiple private virtual interfaces to your Direct Connect gateway. A Direct Connect gateway is a globally available resource. You can create the Direct Connect gateway in any public region and access it from all other public regions.

subnet scope is Availability zone and VPC scope is regional. for example If you want VPC in two regions you must have two VPC (one per region) you can have maximum five VPC per region per account.

the range of CIDR block for ipv4 is from /16 to /28 only.

AWS reserves the four IP and the last IP addresses. In a 10.0.0.0/24, the following IPs are reserved:
	10.0.0.0: Network address.
	10.0.0.1: Reserved by AWS for the Amazon VPC router.
	10.0.0.2: Reserved by AWS. The IP address of the DNS server is always the base of the Amazon VPC network range; however, the base of each subnet range is also reserved.
	10.0.0.3: Reserved by AWS for future use.
	10.0.0.255: Network broadcast address. AWS does not support broadcast in an Amazon VPC; therefore, we reserve this address.
	
Once you choose the size of your Amazon VPC, you cannot change it. Therefore on the side of caution and make your VPC large. A best practice is to identify a private /16 network that is not being used and dedicate that to your VPC.

Route Tables = When a VPC is created, a route table associated with that VPC is also created. This is called the default route table.

we can add destination 0.0.0.0/0 and target Internet-gateway-id to go to internet gateway.

VPC having private subnet with route table having value 0.0.0.0/0   and status blackhole. If you delete a NAT gateway, the NAT gateway routes remain in a blackhole status until you delete or update the routes.
Detaching internet gateway will not create blackhole status in route table. 

Network Access Control Lists (ACLs) = A VPC also has a default network Access Control List (ACL). This default network ACL will allow all inbound and outbound traffic. You can modify network ACLs either by allowing or denying inbound or outbound traffic based on port, protocol, and IP address. You create a number of rules that are evaluated in order, and when a match occurs, that rule gets invoked.

Security Groups = A VPC also has a default security group. by default security groups deny all inbound traffic and allows all outbound traffic. you can only specify allow rules. you can specify seperate rules for inbound and outbound traffice. Security groups are stateful. An instance can have maximum 5 security groups. In case of VPC in addition to all above rules security groups also allow inbound traffice from instances having same security group.

One of the other things that is created with a VPC is a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) option set. The DHCP option set controls various configuration parameters that are passed to compute instances created in the VPC. Some of the parameters are domain name, domain name server, NTP servers, NetBIOS name type, and NetBIOS node type. AWS provides a DNS server by default, but other DNS servers can be used instead.

Our recommended practice is to create two subnets per Availability Zone: one public subnet and one private subnet. The public subnet’s route table includes a route to the Internet. The private subnet’s route table does not include a route to the Internet. An instance in a public subnet has either a public IP or an Elastic IP address assigned to it, while an instance in a private subnet has only a private IP address assigned to it. For an instance in a private subnet to send a packet to the Internet, that packet must be routed through either a Network Address Translation (NAT) instance or a NAT gateway. For an instance in a private subnet to receive a packet from the Internet, that packet must be routed through either the Classic Load Balancer or Application Load Balancer, or through another compute instance with load balancing software installed.

If you no longer need your subnet, you can delete it. before that you must terminate any instances in the subnet first. You will be prompted with an error message in the AWS Console when you try to delete a subnet with instances. Also you need to delete all custom(modified) route tables, network ACLs and security groups except default ones.
The delete-vpc CLI command deletes the specified VPC. You must detach or delete all gateways and resources that are associated with the VPC before you can delete it.
For example, you must terminate all instances running in the VPC, delete all security groups associated with the VPC (except the default one), delete all route tables associated with the VPC (except the default one), and detach or delete internet/virtual private gateways.

A VPC can be created that has no connection to resources outside of the VPC. However, most VPCs have some sort of connection to resources outside the VPC. These connections can take the form of gateways, endpoints, and peering connections. There are three major gateways for the VPC. They are as follows:
	Internet gateway
	NAT gateway/ Egress only gateway
	VPN gateway
	
Internet Gateway = An Internet gateway serves two purposes: to provide a target in your VPC route tables for Internet-routable traffic and to perform network address translation (NAT) for instances that have been assigned public IPv4 addresses. internet gateway supports both ipv4 and ipv6 addresses. 

NAT Gateway = You can use a network address translation (NAT) gateway to enable instances in a private subnet to connect to the Internet or other AWS services, but prevent the Internet from initiating a connection with those instances. NAT Gateway only supports ipv4 traffic
Each NAT gateway is created in a specific Availability Zone and implemented with redundancy in that zone. In NAT gateway you disable souce/destination checking to allow NAT as internet gateway for your private instace.

Egress only internet gateway = only allows outbound(didn't allow to initiate from internet) communitcation over ipv6(ipv4 not supported) to internet. it is stateful and you cannot use security group with it but you can use network acl. Ipv6 addresses are globally unique hence they are public.

VPN Gateway = A VPN gateway is used either to provide (1) an IPsec VPN connection through the Internet to your location or (2) an AWS Direct Connect connection to your location.

you can connect vpc to on-premise network by using IPsec AWS managed VPN connection. A vpn connection consist of virtual private gateway and customer gateway. you can use transit gateway instead of virtual private gateway to connect vpn to multiple vpcs and resources.

NACL are stateless and security groups are stateful.
to understand above statement lets take a example. Consider you only allow inbound traffic in both nACL and security group. so when someone from internet sends a request. It will reach to ec2 instance. Security group will outbound traffice for that ip address for that request even if it explicitly blocks all outbound traffice. This is called stateful. But nACL will block that outbound response as nACL is stateless.

for an internet packet to reach to ec2 instance needs to pass from below three elements in given order from internet to ec2 instace.
1. route table = In vpc we have three route tables(applicable at vpc level) 
	a. default = this route table will be automatically created and it will contain only one address 10.10.0.0/16 local		For CIDR understanding see below. the address provided in this route table helps to resolve local other resources from that same vpc. For both public and private route table content of this table is copied. So please think before adding anything in it.	
 	b. public = public will have one extra address 0.0.0.0/0 IGW	here IGW is a construct for amazon's highly available internet gateway. so any packet in internet having ip address of public subnet can reach in/out using IGW.	
	c. private = this route table will have extra address like 0.0.0.0/0  NAT-ID 	this will use NAT(Network Address Translation) server to connect to internet. So no packet from internet initiates connection to private subnet but instances from private subnet could connect and initialize connection to internet. Also to access private subnet directly you can use VGW (Virtual gateway) from company premise by adding route like this 172.67.0.0/16 VGW.
2. nACL = (applicable at subnet level)by default nACL allows all the inbound and outbound traffic. nACL is optional. Also nACL can have both inbound and outbound rule set. VPC comes with default modifiable nACL. you can specify both allow and deny ruls. You can create a custom network ACL and associate it with a subnet. By default, each custom network ACL denies all inbound and outbound traffic until you add rules.
3. security group = {applicable at ec2 instace (resource)level} by default security groups deny all inbound traffic and allows all outbound traffic. and you can allow by using ip address/range, protocol and port. security group is mandatory. you can only specify allow rules. you can write seperate rules for inbound and outbound traffic. one instance can have max 5 security groups attached to it.

CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) = lets take an example 10.10.0.0/16 it tells that address should be like 10.10.*.* So any address starting from 10.10. The /16 tells us to freeze first 16 bits. any decimal number below 256 can be converted into binary using maximum 8 bits. So /16 means freeze first 16 bits i.e. (10.10) so max you can freeze 28 bits.and min is 16 bits. So /16 gives us 256*256 = 65536 ip addresses to use. to only get traffic from single ip for example you can do this 10.10.23.54/32 ie. freeze all 32 bits. (only single address.) to get traffice from anywhere in internet you can use this 0.0.0.0/0
