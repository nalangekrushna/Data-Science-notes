Elastic Load Balancer (elb) = If you need flexible application management or HTTP requests we recommend that you use an Application Load Balancer. Only Application Load Balancers support WebSockets, path-based routing, host-based routing and support for containerized applications. If extreme performance and static IP or For network/transport protocols (layer4 â€“ TCP, UDP) load balancing, we recommend that you use a Network Load Balancer. If you have an existing application that was built within the EC2-Classic network, then you should use a Classic Load Balancer.

NAT gateway = NAT gateways in each Availability Zone are implemented with redundancy. Create a NAT gateway in each Availability Zone to ensure zone-independent architecture.

you need public subnet, EIP address and internet gateway to create nat gateway. gateway is created in specific AZ and implemented redundancy in same AZ. NAT gateway supports TCP, UDP and ICMP protocols

VPC endpoint = A VPC endpoint enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by AWS PrivateLink without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection. Instances in your VPC do not require public IP addresses to communicate with resources in the service. Traffic between your VPC and the other service does not leave the Amazon network.
Endpoints are virtual devices. They are horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC components. They allow communication between instances in your VPC and services without imposing availability risks or bandwidth constraints on your network traffic.

aws privatelink = provides private connectivity between different/same account VPCs, AWS services, and on-premises applications. VPC endpoints support private connectivity over AWS Direct Connect, so that applications in your premises will be able to connect to these services via the Amazon private network.

If working and prev accessible instance stops working then first check if the instance is terminated then check for aws system status. If system status is impaired then stop and start your instance again to run it on healthy system.

route 53 = 
highly available (global scope) 
	how dns is setup = create public hosted zone of same as domain name. assign a set of 4 name servers to hosted zone. they can point to web server(ec2 instance) or s3 bucket. add this nameservers to domain. you can use alias record to route traffic to s3 bucket or cloudfront distribution (cdn) or other aws resources.
	We can use private dns to resolve dns queries withing amazon vpc. so you can use custom domain names for your internal AWS resources without exposing DNS data to the public Internet.
	
Routing policies for Route 53
	simple = route traffic to single resource. Here you cannot specify multiple ip addresses.
	failover = uses active-passive config. when active instance fails starts routing traffice to passive instance.
	geolocation = route traffice based on end users location. useful for content localization or restrict access by regions.
	geoproximity = route traffice based on location of your resources.
	latency = route traffice based on least latency. useful when you have resources in multiple regions.
	multivalue answer = sends upto 8 healthy records selected at random.
	weighted = route traffic to multiple resources based on proportions that you specify.
	
private hosted zone = to use private hosted zone below properties should be enabled in vpc. enableDnsHostnames, enableDnsSupport . In private hosted zone associate health check can only check weighted and failover records.

traffic policy included below information about routing configuration :
	the routing policy that you want to use.
	resources that you want to traffic to route to such as ec2 instances and domain name of elb
	
dns resolver is regional.

Route 53 health check = this supports three types of health checks.
	1. Health checks that monitor an endpoint.(ip address or domanin name)
	2. calculated health checks = Health checks that monitor other health checks
	3. cloudwatch alarm = Health checks that monitor CloudWatch alarms. 
Egress only internet gateway = only allows outbound(didn't allow to initiate from internet) communitcation over ipv6(ipv4 not supported) to internet. it is stateful and you cannot use security group with it but you can use network acl. Ipv6 addresses are globally unique hence they are public.

Oracle db with RAC config is not supported by aws RDS so you have to use ec2 instance to host oracle db.

bastion host = A bastion host is a special-purpose computer on a network specifically designed and configured to withstand attacks. It is used to connect VPC from internet to get access to resources in private subnet.

RAID = raid is accomplished at software level. For greater I/O performance than you can achieve with a single volume, RAID 0 can stripe multiple volumes together; for on-instance redundancy, RAID 1 can mirror two volumes together which can also offer fault tolerance. RAID 5 and RAID 6 are not recommended for Amazon EBS because the parity write operations of these RAID modes consume some of the IOPS available to your volumes.

aws raid 1 vs raid 0 = raid 0 does striping (spliting data evenly across all the disk) while raid 1 does mirroring (create two copies of data.) use raid 0 when performance (I/O) is important and use raid 1 when fault tolerance and data redundancy is important. raid 1 storage capacity is half as it makes two copies of data. reading speed is same in both raid 0 and 1. but writing speed is less in raid 1.
