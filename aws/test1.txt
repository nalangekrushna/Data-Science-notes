kinesis = aws kinesis is real time fully managed and scalable data streaming service which enables real time data analytics. It can be used with video, audio, logs, website clickstreams as well as IoT telemetry data. Kinesis video stream uses TLS encryption for data at transport and aws KMS to encrypt data at rest.

kinesis data firehose = used to store data in desired aws storages such as s3 bucket or aws redshift.

When you use Amazon Redshift Enhanced VPC Routing, Amazon Redshift forces all COPY and UNLOAD traffic between your cluster and your data repositories through your Amazon VPC. By using Enhanced VPC Routing, you can use standard VPC features, such as VPC security groups, network access control lists (ACLs), VPC endpoints, VPC endpoint policies, internet gateways, and Domain Name System (DNS) servers. Hence, enabling Enhanced VPC routing on your Amazon Redshift cluster is the correct answer. If Enhanced VPC Routing is not enabled, Amazon Redshift routes traffic through the Internet, including traffic to other services within the AWS network.

Your instances are failing to launch for some reason. An error message is saying that "EC2 instance <instance ID> is in VPC. Updating load balancer configuration failed".  ?
-> This error is produced when the ELB and the Auto Scaling group are not created in the same network. Make sure that both are in VPC or in EC2-Classic. 

Auto Scaling = Dynamic scaling responds to changing demand and predictive scaling automatically schedules the right number of EC2 instances based on predicted demand. Dynamic scaling and predictive scaling can be used together to scale faster. Auto Scaling uses both this features for scaling. scaling in means decreasing size whereas scaling out means increasing size. You can specify min, max and desired no of instances. your ec2 instances are orgainzed in groups. groups are treated as logical units for scaling. your group uses launch configuration to launch ec2 instances. we can use lifecycle hooks to to perform custom operations when changing instance state.

scaling policy type = 
	Target tracking scaling = scales in or out to keep target metrics value near to user provided value
	step scaling = adjust in proportional of size of alarm breach. step scaling is better and generall recommended than simple scaling.
	simple scaling = scale in or out upon breach of threshold.
	scheduled scaling = scale in or out at specific timing.
A cooldown period helps you prevent your Auto Scaling group from launching or terminating additional instances before the effects of previous activities are visible. auto scaling marks instance unhealthy if it is in other state than running.

auto scaling standby state = auto scaling didn't do health check on standby instances. standby state is used for performing updates/changes/troubleshooting or replacement instaces being launched.

EBS = you can mount multiple ebs volumes on single instance or you can attach single volume to multiple instances using ebs multi-attach(max 16). ebs volumes are created in an AZ can only be attached to instance in same AZ. you can create snapshot and restore snapshot any wehere in the region to attach to instance outside current AZ. you can use aws managed AWS Backup for ebs volumes. you cannot use hdd (sc1, st1) as boot volume. use raid 0 to maximize utilization of instance resources.  
The maximum ratio of provisioned IOPS to requested volume size (in GiB) is 50:1.
For example, a 100 GiB volume can be provisioned with up to 5,000 IOPS. On a supported instance type, any volume 1,280 GiB in size or greater allows provisioning up to the 64,000 IOPS maximum (50 Ã— 1,280 GiB = 64,000).

data analytics application = high sequential read-write access = storage optimized instances.

vpc = you can connect vpc to on-premise network by using IPsec AWS managed VPN connection. A vpn connection consist of virtual private gateway and customer gateway. you can use transit gateway instead of virtual private gateway to connect vpn to multiple vpcs and resources.
