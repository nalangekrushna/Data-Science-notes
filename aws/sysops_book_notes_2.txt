IAM = Identity and Access Management = this controls what anyone can do with aws cloud service.
An IAM best practice is to use the principle of least privilege

IAM User = An IAM user is an entity created in an AWS account that provides a way to interact with
the resources in the account. A user can be any individual, system, or application that
interacts with AWS resources, either programmatically or manually. When an AWS account is created, the credentials used at account creation become the root user account ID. A best practice is not to use the root user account credentials and instead create a separate IAM user with all administrative privileges.
Use that IAM user to apply the principle of least privilege by creating additional individual IAM accounts for your various users.

IAM Credentials
Email address and password = Associated with the AWS account root user
IAM user name and password = Used to access the AWS Management Console
aws cli and sdk = access key ID  and secret access key
key pairs = Used only for specific AWS Cloud services like Amazon EC2

Signature Version 4 = calculates the signature using the Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC)-Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) 256 protocol. Version 4 provides an additional measure of protection over previous versions by requiring that you sign the message using a key that is derived from your secret access key instead of using the secret access key itself. In addition, you derive the signing key based on credential scope, which facilitates cryptographic isolation of the signing key.

Access keys comprise two components:
	Access key ID
	Secret access key
The access key is active by default. Each user can have two active access keys. This enables access keys to be rotated without the user temporarily losing access to his AWS account.
IAM roles provide
temporary credentials, which are not only automatically loaded to the target instance, but are also automatically rotated multiple times a day.

A best practice is to rotate access keys regularly for all of the IAM users in an AWS account. Unnecessary credentials should be removed from users who do not need them. The root user access keys should not be used. The recommended practice is to delete the root user access keys.

IAM Policies = IAM Polices are JSON-formatted permission documents that are used to grant or deny access to IAM users. By default, an IAM user cannot do anything with any service in an AWS account, even if he has authentication credentials. Permission to take actions with a service must be explicitly provided to individual users, groups, or roles.

An IAM policy consists of four main elements:
	Action
	Effect
	Resource
	Conditions (optional)
	
IAM policy rules have an order of precedence. If an action is explicitly denied, it is denied; then if an action is explicitly allowed, it is allowed. Otherwise, all other actions are implicitly denied.
An IAM policy can also use policy conditions for extra security. For example, conditions could be set so that requests must originate from a specifi c range of IP addresses, or a request must use SSL or MFA.
There are two types of IAM policies:
	Managed policies = Managed policies can be customer- and AWS-managed. These policies are standalone policies that are attached to multiple users, groups, and roles. AWS-managed policies are created by AWS. Customer-managed policies are created and managed by customers.
	Inline policies = Inline policies are embedded in a principal entity such as a user, group, or role. The policy is an inherent part of the entity. The same policy can be used for multiple entities, but those entities do not share the policy. Instead, each entity has its own copy of the policy (that is, inline policies cannot be centrally managed).
The IAM console provides “service last accessed data” about when IAM users and roles last attempted to access AWS Cloud services.

IAM Roles = IAM Roles are temporary user credentials. IAM user credentials are regarded as static credentials. temporary credentials consisting of the following:
	Access key ID
	Secret access key
	Token
	Duration
	
Best Practices for Securing Your AWS Account :
1. Require MFA for root-level access.
2. Do not share root credentials with anyone other than the account holder.
3. Physically secure root account hardware MFA devices in a safe place, such as a vault.
4. Create individual IAM users.
5. Use groups to assign permissions to IAM users.
6. Enable MFA for privileged users.
7. Use IAM roles for applications that run on Amazon EC2 instances.
8. Delegate by using IAM roles instead of sharing credentials.
9. Rotate credentials regularly.
10. Remove unnecessary credentials.
11. Use policy conditions for extra security.
12. Monitor activity on your AWS account.
13. Remove root credentials.
14. Use access levels to review IAM permissions.
15. Use AWS-defined policies to assign permissions whenever possible.
16. Use IAM roles to provide cross-account access.
