nginx_deployment

problem statement :
Deploy nginx as reverse proxy with apache tomcat to generate dynamic pages and serve static pages directly from nginx itself. Also setup ssl certificate for website.

reason for this reverse proxy setup is nginx server is great at serving static content while tomcat is great at serving dynamic content. So it makes perfect combination.
logs, load balancer, reverse proxy with cache and web socket proxying, log rotation, fastCGI
