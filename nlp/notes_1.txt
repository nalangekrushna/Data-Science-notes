when we talk their is one speaker and other is listener.
speaker should have following things.
	Intention (goals, shared knowledge and belief).
	Generation (tactical)
	Synthesis (text to speech)
Listener should have following things.
	Perception
	Interpretation (syntactic, semantic, pragmatic)
	Incorporation(internalization, understanding)
Both 
	context (grounding)
	
language (understanding) -> computer (generation) -> language

CL = Computational Linguistic
IR = Information retrieval
