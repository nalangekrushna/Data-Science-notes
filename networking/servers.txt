1. Open/forward proxy = A forward proxy provides proxy service to client or host of clients. Sometime its also acts as cache. When user says proxy server he usually means forward or open proxy server. Forward proxy hides identity of client.
2. Reverse proxy server = reverse proxy accepts requests from external client on behalf of server stationed behind it.

Reverse proxy also acts as load balancer.
