variable names = Officially, variable names in Python can be any length and can consist of uppercase and lowercase letters (A-Z, a-z), digits (0-9), and the underscore character (_). An additional restriction is that, although a variable name can contain digits, the first character of a variable name cannot be a digit.

One of the additions to Python 3 was full Unicode support, which allows for Unicode characters in a variable name as well.

PEP-8 guideline :
    Snake Case should be used for functions packages, modules and variable names.(all small no caps and underscore to seperate)
    Pascal Case should be used for class names and exceptions.(Identical to Camel Case, except the first word is also capitalized.)
	all caps for constants.
	two ways to write dictionary can be key_value or key_value_dict.(personal opinion).
	for list it is add s at the end.
	
Reserved words are case-sensitive. They are all entirely lowercase, except for False, None, and True.
Trying to create a variable with the same name as any reserved word results in an SyntaxError.

python
	all imports should be in one place
	all hard-coded value should be kept in dict at the top.
	All file paths must be compatible in windows and linux and try to keep absolute.
	(best way to do this is use unix file nameing system. e.g. use this "C:/temp/abc")
	(python added new module pathlib for file paths use it in future instad of os module.)
	we will combine both approaches ie. using unix file naming inside pathlib module. 
	Naming conventions :
		all constansts should be in caps.
		dict naming should be key_value and if needed as dict suffix.
		add plural forms in words to indicate list
	use logger instead of print statements.	and should be in file and stdout.

Naming conventions for db
	try to use python naming conventions as it will be consistent with backend.
