variable names = Officially, variable names in Python can be any length and can consist of uppercase and lowercase letters (A-Z, a-z), digits (0-9), and the underscore character (_). An additional restriction is that, although a variable name can contain digits, the first character of a variable name cannot be a digit.

One of the additions to Python 3 was full Unicode support, which allows for Unicode characters in a variable name as well.

PEP-8 guideline :
    Snake Case should be used for functions packages, modules and variable names.(all small no caps and underscore to seperate)
    Pascal Case should be used for class names and exceptions.(Identical to Camel Case, except the first word is also capitalized.)
	all caps for constants.
	two ways to write dictionary can be key_value or key_value_dict.(personal opinion).
	for list it is add s at the end.
	
Reserved words are case-sensitive. They are all entirely lowercase, except for False, None, and True.
Trying to create a variable with the same name as any reserved word results in an SyntaxError.
