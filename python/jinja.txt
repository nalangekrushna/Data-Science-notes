Jinja2 template

jinja is a templating language. templating language is a language containing variables and programming logic which when evaluated( rendered into html) are replaced with actual values. variables and logic is placed in between tag or delimiter. jinja template uses {%...%} for expressions and logic like for loop while {{...}} for variable output. Please note that {%...%} logic inside this is not shown to end user/webpage.
e.g. {% for n in my_list %}
        <li>{{n}}</li>
        {% endfor %}
		
only output of {{n}} will be shown to the user. 

jinja templates are just .html files. They live in /templates folder of flask project. jinja only support if statement and for loop. Its syntax is same as python except the end is done by endif or endfor. 

use tag {% extends %} and {% block %} to implement inheritance. use {% block %} to fill in child template.
