python basics

list comphrehensions = compact syntax for deriving one list from another.
if you need to filter or select only subset of elements  below is the syntax.
lst = [ i for i in lst if i > condition ]
if you need to apply both if else condition then below is the syntax
lst = [ i if i > condition else i*2  for i in lst ] 

to create generator instead of list
gen = ( for i in lst )

use list comphrehension instead of map and filter. but in concurrent programming use map and filter instead of list comphrehension. The alternative to reduce is itertools.accumulate. Also for large no of loops or values use generator instead of list.
