Python Testing

exploratory testing = exploring the application and checking its features are working fine.
unit test = checks if single component operates in right way.
integration test = checks that components in your application operate with each other.

test fixture = text fixture is a preparation needed to perform one or more tests and any associated cleanup actions.e.g creating temp db or directory or starting a server process.
test cases = individual unit of testing. It checks for specific response for particular set of inputs.
test suite  = test suite is collection of individual test cases or other test suites. It aggregates tests that should run together.
parameterization = If youâ€™re running the same test and passing different values each time and expecting the same result
test runner = test runner is a special application designed for running tests, checking the output and giving you tools for debugging and diagnosis tests and application.


There are three popular test runners 1. unittest  2.nose2   3. pytest
we will be using unittest as it comes with python standard library.

Unittest = unittest contains both test framework and test runner. unittest has below three requirments.
	1. put tests inside classes as methods
	2. use special assertion methods in unittest.TestCase class instead of built-in assert statement.
	3. method used in unittest testing must be start with "test" case sensitive.
