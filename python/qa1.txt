API vs REST API
API = is a interface which defines how to applications can talk with each other. It defines request type, request format so that anyone with right type and format could send request to application.
REST (REpresentational State Transfer) is a type of API. rest is a standardized set of rules/standard/guideline to how to build an API. other popular api types are SOAP and GraphQL.

request is made up of four things
1. endpoint = e.g. https://example.com/test?query1=value1&query2=value2 here https://example.com is root endpoint while /test is a path. the final part the part after ? is called query parameters and & is used to join two query parameters. 
2. type = GET, POST, PUT DELETE, there are others but rest is mainly concerned with this four.
3. header = 
4. body (data)

A api is called restful api if it follows rest style.
1. use right request type for right operation.
2. use identifiers in url instead of query strings. query strings are good for filtering.
3. use plurals instead of collection metaphors(like list set or dictionary.)
	e.g  right /users/12345
	     wrong /api?user=12345   or user_list/12345
4. use lower case and use underscore and hyphen to seperate words. 
5. use right http response code to indicate status.
6. favor json over xml.

idempotent = for an operation (or service call) to be idempotent, clients can make that same call repeatedly while producing the same result.
