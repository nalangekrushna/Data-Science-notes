python descriptors 

Properties in python are just descriptors.

Descriptors  = descriptors are python objects that implement a method of descriptor protocol which is used to create object that have special behaviour when they are accessed as attribute of other objects.
If your descriptor only implements .__get__() then it is called non-data descriptor. If your descriptor also implements .__set__() and .__delete__() then it is called data descriptor. Both behave differently and data descriptors have preference over non-data descriptor in lookup.

The best practise is that to implement read-only descriptors, define set method and raise an error inside it instead of actually setting value.
