Strings are immutable in python.
The ord() function returns the integer value for a given character. But you can only specify a single character (a string of length 1).
chr() = converts integer to character.

String operations
	* = s*n where s is string and n is integer.Youâ€™d think it would be required to be a positive integer, but amusingly, it can be zero or negative, in which case the result is an empty string.
	
negative indexing for string
s = 'foobar'
>>> s[-1]
'r'
>>> len(s)
6
>>> s[-len(s)]
'f'
