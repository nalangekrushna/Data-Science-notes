Linked list = Linked lists differ from lists in the way that they store elements in memory. While lists use a contiguous memory block to store references to their data, linked lists store references as part of their own elements.
Each element of a linked list is called a node, and every node has two different fields:
    Data contains the value to be stored in the node.
    Next contains a reference to the next node on the list.
A linked list is a collection of nodes. The first node is called the head, and itâ€™s used as the starting point for any iteration through the list. The last node must have its next reference pointing to None to determine the end of the list. 
task : implement stack and queue using linked list.
