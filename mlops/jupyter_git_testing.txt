Git testing for jupyter notebooks
Here we are testing git responses on different scenarios for objective of triggering machine learning pipeline only on appropriate scenarios. 

Update :- We are skipping testing as there is an already very well maintained and supported tool to use with git and jupyter notebooks. Below is the link
https://github.com/fastai/nbdev
 
 


Expected results :
	trigger = git status commands says the file is modified. and pipeline should be triggered in case of commit or push.
	skip = git status command don't say file is modified. As there are no changes in code the pipeline will not trigger in case of commit or push.
Actual Results :
	In actual result we will check only git status of the file. 
	
Scenario - Expected result - Actual result

1. Add new code. - trigger - trigger
2. modify the code. - trigger - trigger
3. Add/update/delete comment - skip - trigger
4. Add new empty cell. - skip - 
5. Add new empty cell with comments. - skip - 
6. Run cell for first time. - skip - 
7. Change in cell number due to rerun of cell. - skip - skip
8. Add output due to first time running of cell. - skip - 
9. Change of output due to rerun of cell. - skip - skip
10 create new empty notebook with and without comment but not a single line of code. - skip - 
11. Add new cell with code. - trigger -
