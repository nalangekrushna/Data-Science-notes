different views of tensorflow
Scalars - Visualize scalar values, such as classification accuracy.
Graph - Visualize the computational graph of your model, such as the neural network model.
Distributions - Visualize how data changes over time, such as the weights of a neural network.
Histograms - A fancier view of the distribution that shows distributions in a 3-dimensional perspective
