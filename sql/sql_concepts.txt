Atomicity = Either complete transaction takes place at once or doesn't happen at all.
Consistency = any data written to db must be valid according to all the defined rules including constraints and triggers.
Isolation = multiple transactions can occur concurrently without leading to inconsistency of database state.
Durability = Once tha transaction has completed execution, Its results are persisted even in case of system failure.
