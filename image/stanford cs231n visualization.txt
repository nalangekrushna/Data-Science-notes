
what is going inside convnets ?

First Layer : no of convolutional filters.for convolutional filter size check image classification stanford cs231n.txt
almost on all deep net architects first layer you will get edge detection.

Last Layer : you can visualize weights using pca or tsne in last layer.

middle layers : visualize feature maps will be helpful in some cases.
				guided backprop = find a part of image that neurons respond to
				gradient ascent = generate a synthetic image that maximally activates the neuron.

testing 
one way to check what network is learning is occlusion experiment.
Saliency maps are another way to find which pixels are important for image classification.

one more Idea
train the deep learning model using data.
Then apply gradient ascent with regularization onto it.
get the image back for every class.
now try to preprocess testing images to look like gradient ascented images.
