linux uses /(forward slash) instead of \(backward slash) of windows.
~ = to home directory of logged in user.(root/user_name/)
/ = absolute root (containing all folders such as bin boot dev lib var tmp)
FileSystem Hierachy Standard = FHS = maintained by linux foundation.

bin(binary) = it contains ls, cat like things. which normal user will have access to.(multi user mode or general mode.)
sbin = it contains programs which only system admin have access to.(single user mode)
