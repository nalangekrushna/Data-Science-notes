Jenkins

what is jenkins ?
jenkins is open source cross-platform automation server written in java. jenkins helps in CI/CD by automating parts related to build test and deploy. Jenkins has large number of plugins and very active community support. 

to setup jenkins build with git commit

how ? 
Jenkins uses pipelines to create automated deployment process. pipeline can use both declarative vs scripted pipeline syntax. declarative is latest one and feature rich than scripted. This pipeline can be stored in root folder of project to track in source control management(git) in "Jenkinsfile" file. Agent is must in declarative pipelines. Groovy language is used for scripting purpose in jenkins.

We can change the name "Jenkinsfile" to any other, in that case in projects configuration in pipeline tab we need to pass file name in Script Path field.

Jenkins Agents types = Agents are the worker nodes where actual execution of pipeline happens.
	any = execute pipeline on any available agent.
	none = when applied at top level, it means each stage should contain its own agent section.
	label = pipeline will run on any node having provided label.
	docker = execute pipeline or stage with given container which will be dynamically provisioned on a node pre-configured to accept docker based pipeline.
	dockerfile = excecute pipeline or stage with container build from dockerfile contained in source code repo.
	kubernetes = execute pipeline or stage inside a pod deployed on kubernetes cluster.

The basic statements and expressions which are valid in Declarative Pipeline follow the same rules as Groovyâ€™s syntax with the following exceptions:
	The top-level of the Pipeline must be a block, specifically: pipeline { }.
	No semicolons as statement separators. Each statement has to be on its own line.
	Blocks must only consist of Sections, Directives, Steps, or assignment statements.
	A property reference statement is treated as a no-argument method invocation. So, for example, input is treated as input().
	
what is CI (Continuous Integration) = It is a process where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently. This integratios can be verified by automated builds and optionallly automated testing.

what is CD (continuous deployment) = process of keeping code deployable at any point of time or automatically releasing new test or production environments when they pass automated testing.

continuous delivery vs deployments = In delivery you do manual production deployment whereas in deployment you do automated production deployment.

what is Jenkinsfile ?
The text file with all pipeline definitions is called Jenkinsfile. It can be checked in the version control system(git).

what is pipeline ?
pipeline consists of build, deploy, test, release stages. Pipeline is a group of build jobs that are chained and integrated in sequence. Pipelines can be written in two different ways.
	1. Scripted pipeline
	2. Declarative pipeline

what is scripted pipeline is Jenkins ?
It starts with node

what is declarative pipeline in Jenkins ?
It starts with pipeline 

Top level element of pipeline in called block (ie. pipeline{ })
block consists of sections, directives, steps and assigned statements.
Sections consist of one or more directives or steps.
Directives allows you to define list of parameters to be used in the script.


pipeline -> agent, environment, options, tools, post, parameters, triggers, stages -> stage -> agent, environment, when, steps, post, parallel

which command can be used to start jenkins manually ?
(jenkinsurl)/restart = restarts immediately
(jenkinsurl)/safeRestart = wait for job to complete if it is running.

what are build triggers ?
Triggers used to run the job periodically or remotely. different ways to trigger the build are 
	1. after completion of other builds
	2. by scm commit 
	3. at specific time.(periodically)
	4. manually

what is post in jenkins ?
Post section contains additional steps to be performed. Its value can be changed, unstable, failure, success, always and aborted.

different types of projects in jenkins ?
	freestyle = It combines scm with any build system.
	pipeline = long running sequential or parallel tasks spanning multiple build agents.
	multi-config = projects with large no of different configurations as well as different platforms.
	multi-brach = set of pipeline projects from single repo having multiple branches.
	
how to resolve broken build ?
open console output to check the output logs.
	
how to take backup in jenkins
JENKINS_HOME has all the data copy jenkins_home somewhere to take the backup. also you can use thinBackup plugin. In linux jenkins home in ~/.jenkins/   In windows you can find it in C:/users/<user_name>/.jenkins
or C:\Program Files (x86)\Jenkins

copy job from Jenkins_home/jobs/job_name to another installation on jenkins
change job_name to new_job_name to renme existing job.

how to run stages in parallel ?
from declarative pipeline 1.2 you can add parallel stage inside stage. Inside parallel you can again add different stage to run in parallel.

Jenkins directives
environment = set environment variables for the execution.
options = set different options related to pipeline execution such as retry, skip default checkout, timeout, timestamp.
parameters = list of parameters that user should provide when triggering the pipeline.
triggers = defines automated ways in which pipeline should be re-triggered. triggers are generally used with cron, pollscm and upstream jobs.
stage = Goes inside stages section and should contain step section. practically speaking all real work done by pipeline will be wrapped in one or more stage directive.
tools = tools to auto install and put on the path. It supports maven, jdk and gradle for now.
input = input directive allows you to prompt for input using input step.
when = when directive allows the pipeline to determine wheather stage should be executed depending upon given condition.
