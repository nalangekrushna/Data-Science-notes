containerization vs virtualization 
both containers and vm are software technologies that create self contained virtual packages.
Virtual machines programmed to emulate hardware of physical computer with complete os. vmwares make it possible to run multiple computers with multiple os on single physical server. 

Hypervisor = virtualization will not be possible without hypervisor. hypervisor is software or firmware layer which orchestrate and seperates available resources aligning a portion to each vm.  

vmware disadvantages = since each vm contains its own copy of os and all virtual hardware the os requires, it takes significant ram and cpu resources.
sdlc is more complex with vmwares. 
moving vm between traditional data centers and public clouds can be challenging.

containers  = containers share host os with with other containers. and shared part is read-only. 
container disadvantages = container based on different os requires different host.
beacuase os is shared security vulneribility of os kernel is threat to all containers.

vmwares should be used when you need full functionality of os or you have different os. containers should be used when you want to mimimize no of servers.

docker disadvantages = 
1. docker don't run at bare metal speed.
2. the container ecosystem is fractured.
3. persistent data storage is complicated.
4. the only microservices based appliction benefit from it. For others it is just a packaging solution.
5. graphical applications don't work well with docker.

what is sidecar pattern ?
sidecar pattern contains two seperate containers. one contains core functionality and other contains supporting/ augmented functionalities such as logging and monitoring.
