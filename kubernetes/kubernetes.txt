Kubernetes 101

application -> container -> pods -> replicaSet -> deployment

Kubernetes Architecture -
	1. Master nodes(Control plane)
	2. Worker nodes
master component/node = master node running inside kubernetes cluster. master node runs api server, schedular, etcd and controller manager. It is responsible for managing kubernetes cluster. 

workflow = user will execute some command using kubectl client. Kubectl will handle authorization with api server of master node. If authorization is successful then your command will be processed. Api server will first store data to etcd. Etcd will also store multiple other details in key value format. After that depending upon the command api server will send it to either controller manager or scheduler and will get some response back. After that api server will call kubelets inside the worker node.

Kubernetes components can be broadly classified into two categories. 
	A. Control plane components
		1. kube-apiserver
		2. etcd
		3. kube-schedular
		4. kube-controller-manager - some of the controllerrs are beow.
			i. node controller
			ii. job controller 
			iii. endpoint controller
			iv. service account and token controller 
		5. cloud-controller-manager
	B. Node components
		1. kubelet
		2. kube-proxy
		3. container runtime engine


Etcd = Etcd is distributed, consistent key value store used for config mgmt, service discovery and co-ordinating distributed work. Very Important : keep a backup plan of etcd. Etcd also provide etcdctl a cli tool to set update remove and access values. 
 
kube-api server = It will process rest operations, validate them and update corresponding object in etcd. Only api server connects to etcd. Api server will also do authentication and authorization.

kube-controller-manager = control plane component that runs controller processes. Logically each controller is seperate process but to reduce complexity they all are compiled into single binary and run in single process.
a. node controller - It pings nodes every 5 seconds with grace period of 40 seconds and pod eviction timeout of 5 minutes.
grace period is time after which node is marked as unhealthy. pod eviction timeout is time after which node will be evicted. 
b. replication controller = ensures that specified number of pod replicas are running at any one time.

kube-Schedular = Schedular watches for unscheduled pods and bind them to nodes. During binding pod schedular will take care of following 
1. availability or requested resources
2. quality of service requirement
3. Affinity and anti-affinity specifications 
4. Other constraints
Once the pod has node assigned, the regular behaviour of kubelet is triggered and pod and its containers are created. 

Kubelet = an kubernetes agent who registers node with kube-apiserver using hostname or cloud provider specific logic. It also takes care of creating a pod and monitoring nodes and pods.

Kube-proxy = kubeproxy runs on every node as a form of daemon set. It monitors changes to the service object and translates them into actual network rules inside the node. 

pods = pods are the smallest deployable units that you can create and manage. pod can contain more than 1 containers.
Pod states = Pending ( one or more container is not ready to run, it also includes time required to download the image)
Running ( pod is bound to node, Atleast one container is running or process of starting or restarting.)
Succeeded = All container in pod terminated in success and will not be restarted.
Failed = all containers terminated, atleast one terminated in failure due to non-zero exit code or terminated by system.
Unknown = this phase occur due to error in communicating with nodes.

Other than above container also has waiting, running and terminated state.
default container restart policy is always, other options are OnFailure and Never.

ReplicaSet = Replicaset runs multiple instances of pods and keeps desired number of pods running.

deployment = manages pods and replicaset in declarative way.
Use cases : update applications, scale application, rollback to previous version.

service = helps you  expose group of pods over a network
method of exposing network application that is running as one or more pods in your cluster.
pods are created and destroyed dynamically and each pod get it's own ip address. 
service is a type of resource that configures proxy to forward request to set of pods which is determined by selector. Once the service is created it will have an ip address which will accept the request on port. Below are the types of services
1. ClusterIP = This is default service type which exposes service on cluster-internal IP address by making service only reachable within the cluster. You can use ingress or Gateway to expose it to public internet.
2. NodePort = This exposes service on each nodes IP at static port. Since a ClusterIP service to which NodePort service will route is automatically created. we can connect NodePort service outside the cluster. It can select any port between range 32000 to 32767. 
3. LoadBalancer = This service type will expose service externally using cloud providers load balancer. So the NodePort and ClusterIP to which LB will route traffic are automatically created.
4. ExternalName = maps service to externalName field by returning CNAME record with external hostname value. This is useful when you want to use website. This will again map to LB.

Headless Service = Headless service allows client to connect whichever pod they prefer directly. It doesn't route client request like regular service does. Below are some of the use cases :
1. stateful applications
2. advance health checks
3. custom load-balancing logic

Kubernetes Service Discovery :
1. Environment Variables = kubernetes adds two env variables for each active service in pods. <service_name>_searvice_host and <service_name>_service_port. Here service name is uppercase and dashes are converted into underscores.
2. DNS(prefered) = dns addons such as coreDNS watches kubernetes api for new services and creates a set of dns records for each one. kubernetes dns server is the only way to access ExternalName service.


Kubernetes Namespaces = namespaces allows user to create virtual space within the same physical cluster. Kubernetes namespace can be seen as logical entity used to represent cluster resources for usage of particular set of users. Namespace cannot be nested. Each resource could be only in one namespace. By default kubernetes creates following three namespaces :
1. default = It holds all the default set of pods, services and deployments used by the cluster.
2. kube-public = automatically created namespace for resources that are publically available/readable by all inside the cluster even if they are not authenticated.
3. kube-system = automatically created namespace for objects created by kubernetes system. 
4. kube-node-lease = holds lease objects associated with each node. 

In real world you can create namespace for development, qa and production environment.

Networking in kubernetes = There are 4 types of network communications 
1. Container to Container = There are two types of communication 
a. both the containers are in same pod.(Inter-node communication)
Containers talk with each other using localhost. Containers allocated to same host shares network stack and other resources. So they can reach out to each other using localhost but the port must be different. when a pod contains multiple containers, docker will setup a single virtual ethernet for all the containers so for all of them localhost is the same.   
b. container1 in pod1 and container2 in pod2(Intra-node communication)
In this case first container1 will send request to pod1. Then pod1 sends request to pod2. and then pod2 will send request to container2. 
2. pod to pod
3. pod to service =

4. service to external

Kubernetes High Availability Overview = Each master replica will run following component in following modes
1. etcd instance = all instance will be working and having consistent data.
2. API server = all api servers will be working and will be communicating with local etcd instances. 
3. Controller, Schedular, Cluster Auto-Scaler = Only one instance will be active in given cluster, all other instances in that cluster will be idle.
4. Add-on manager = It is used to add multiple plugins. Each add-on manager will be working trying to keep all addons in sync.
5. Load Balancing = in HA mode kubernetes master node binds with LB and connect LB with floating virtual IP. 
6. worker Nodes = worker nodes will communicate with master node in HA mode only using Load balancer. Also all master nodes with also communicate with each other using only Load Balancer in HA mode.

Kubernetes multi container deployment best practises
create a namespace and deploy all containers in it.

Imperative object management vs declarative object management
Kubernetes object management must be done by only one of the method. You should never mix both the methods.
commands used in imperative are create, update, delete. Commands used in declarative management are apply and diff. In imperative command you tell kubenetes to exactly what to create, update or delete and you don't tell kubernetes how cluster should look like. In declarative update we tell kubernetes to make necessary changes so cluster should look like this.
