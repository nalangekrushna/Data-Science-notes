Design kubernetes cluster

use namespaces
design a multi node cluster with multiple masters.
use kubeadm
persistent shared volume across multiple pods
label nodes with specific disk types
node selector ie. taints and tolerance
don't do any job on master node.
choose a networking solution  = flannel or weavenet or others
use configmaps and secrets
for logging use elk stack.
docker image busybox or alpine
Use ingress
use replicaset and deployments
use services
node affinity
daemonsets
static pods
multi container pod
initContainer
RBAC
service accounts
Image security
Persistent Volumes
Persistent Volume Claims
healthchecks and readiness probe

Deploy python/java webapp on kubernetes cluster, connect ci/cd pipeline to it.
Install kubernetes - Use kubeadm HA cluster.
	HA cluster should contain atleast two master nodes ,3*2 worker nodes.

Choose os for master and worker nodes
lowest resource consuming and small in size mainted linux with debian base, apt package manager and Systemd as startup is
	Papermint os.

minikube start --nodes 4 -p website


apache http server
apache tomcat
nginx
jetty

nginx

deployments - 
	nodejs - final output will be js, css and html so nginx directly.
	python - gunicorn/uwsgi - nginx
	java - apache tomcat /jetty (microservices)
	angular - It is also js so only apache http server.
