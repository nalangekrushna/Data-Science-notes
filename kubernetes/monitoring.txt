Monitoring

Kubernetes uses Metrics server for monitoring.
Metrics Server = provides container resource metrics for kubernetes build-in autoscaling pipelines.
metrics server collects resource metrics from kubelets and exposes them to kubernetes api server through metrics api to be used by Horizontal Pod Autoscaler and Vertical Pod Autoscaler.

To collect metrics for monitoring solutions use kubelets /metrics/resource endpoint directly.
