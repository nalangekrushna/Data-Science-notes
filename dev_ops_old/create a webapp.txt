decide where to install jenkins for HA.
write new jenkins pipelines 
In production instead of using docker image for mysql use db services from cloud provider
But just for learning purposes now we will create a mysql docker image.
create container for mysql
In kubernetes app design should be like 4 nodes each containing one pod out of which two pods runs web app and two pods runs db containers. the persistent volumes between db should be managed.   
Also use kubernetes to manage both containers 1. mysql and 2. web app

try to use distroless in Dockerfile. Currently in a beta phase wait for production release.
check if minideb can be used and is it free for commercial use 

kubectl create -f single_pod.yml 
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
kubectl get nodes
kubectl delete --all pods --namespace=test

127.0.0.0/8

test this things on kubernetes
create three nodes
connect to internet by worker node (maybe using serivce)
both worker node should access same storage (use pv and pvc)
worker node/pod will die in between (manually close worker node)
the image will be used from local private repo. currently working on
