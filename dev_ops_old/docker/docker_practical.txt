Building docker image a practical guide

Use LTS versions
Whenever possible use Alpine except for Python
Use JRE instead of JDK in runner builds
For builder stage use JDK instead of JRE.
whenever there is compilation use multi-stage builds
For java use eclipse temurin over any other open source java build.

Docker build time secrets  --build-arg can work for multi stage builds
Docker runtime secrets(db password etc)
Do config/secret management in kubernetes
