Kubernetes logging

Generally when app crashes or stops the logs are intact. but in kubernetes it cleans/deletes the pods so logs are also gone. So it is important to create/use centralized log management system. 

kubernetes uses metric-server addon for logs and visualization. This addon has no capability of storing the data. So use third party log mgmt tool such as elastic stack for log storage, mgmt and visualization.
