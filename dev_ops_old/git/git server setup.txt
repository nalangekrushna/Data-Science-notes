
To Setup Local server

1) initialize local directory on remote where you want to setup with below command
git init --bare directory_name.git

2) In your project setup remote to local directory by using below command.
git init
git remote add origin directory_name.git

directory_name.git = absolute full path

3) push code to remote server
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
git push -u origin master

-u = for first time push.

4) setup pull to check everything working
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/master
git pull

to remove origin
git remote rm origin

To rename from Master to main
1. Rename the local branch
git branch -m master main

2. Push changes to remote repo
git push -u origin main

Incomplete changes please first add remaining command then test the solution and then only update.
