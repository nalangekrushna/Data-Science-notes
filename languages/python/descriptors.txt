python descriptors 

Properties in python are just descriptors.

what is descriptor ?
A descriptor lets you execute arbitrary code when reading or setting (or deleting) a value. It is used to do some operations such as orm object creation or making object read-only.

Descriptors  = If your descriptor only implements .__get__() then it is called non-data descriptor. If your descriptor also implements .__set__() and .__delete__() then it is called data descriptor. Both behave differently and data descriptors have preference over non-data descriptor in lookup.

The best practise to implement read-only descriptors, define set method inside data descriptor and raise an error inside it instead of actually setting value.
