naming conventions for Python identifiers âˆ’

Class names start with an uppercase letter. All other identifiers start with a lowercase letter.

Starting an identifier with a single leading underscore indicates that the identifier is private.

Starting an identifier with two leading underscores indicates a strong private identifier.

If the identifier also ends with two trailing underscores, the identifier is a language-defined special name.
Multi-Line Statements use \
The triple quotes are used to span the string across multiple lines.

	Big Data Strategy 
		Are your data volumes truly big = first consider are u collecting enough.
		You really need that much data.
		Is your dataset is relatively stable and slow moving.
		Is that data analysis really useful?
		Are you ready for such a volume,velocity and variety
		YOu have that skills and domain expertise to work with big data.
		If your business is smaller it didn't mean you don't have big data.
			
	Major choices
		big data or conventional
		Hadoop or MPP or Hybrid
		NoSQL or NewSQL
		On Premises or Cloud
		
	Hadoop Distribution choices
		Major or Specialized distribution
		Cloudera or Hortonworks or other
		MapR or Hadapt
		
	Scaling across cores rather than nodes = pervasive datarush
	
	Overall Decisions
		decide if hadoop is necessary, desired or inappropriate
		formulate your goal and destination
		decide where BI and NoSQL fits in
		determine wheather u will go cloud or on premise
		weigh personal skills and set economics
		pilot refine implement and repeat
