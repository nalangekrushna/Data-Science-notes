data is number with context. If we consider humnan as unit of observation. then data set consist of number of humans. and his age, height, weight becomes properties or variables. There are three types of variables
	i) categorized variables = these categories do not have arithmatic meaning e.g. race,gender,nationality.
	ii) quantitative variables = values that can actuallly averaged or sumed. e.g. height weight age
	iii) ordinal variables = it does have an order. eg. education, frequecy of exercise. 
the statistics are summaries of numerical data.but they do not tell stories.but they are useful.
