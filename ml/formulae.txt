Formulae

mean/avg = sum of elements/no of elements

median = Median is the middle number in a sorted list of numbers.
median =  (no of values/2)+1 (odd count) position value is median.
	   x = no of values/2
	   y = (no of values/2)+1
median value for even no of values = (x+y)/2

variance(sigma^2) =  (sum of square of (x_i-mean(x)))/ no of x_i
				  = avg((x_i-mean(x)^2)
standard deviation = sqrt(variance)

co-variance = avg((x_i - mean(x)) * (y_i - mean(y)))

Pearson correlation coef = covarince(X,y)/(sigma(x)*sigma(y))
