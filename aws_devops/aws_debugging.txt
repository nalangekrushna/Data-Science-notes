your website url(moviehacks.in) is not accessible ?
Below are the steps to to follow. first check if ec2 instance is running and accessible
	1. check instance state. It should be "Running". 
	2. check security groups inbound rules. make sure your opened port(80,443 or 5000) and application port are same. Also make sure the protocols(http,https,tcp) are also same.
	3. In special cases like https protocol with 5000 port(flask app) select custom tcp and 5000 as port no.
	4. You should able to open app using protocol://Public_IPv4_address:port means you're ec2 instance is working fine. Public IPv4 DNS is used for address resolution of Public_IPv4_address.
After confirming this try to connect using load balancer.
	1. when we use http the default port is 80 and when https default port is 443. So to keep connection secure redirect http requests to https with 302 status code. 
	2. https request to be forwarded to ec2 target groups with port 5000. So for security group of instances only custom tcp with 5000 port inbound should be allowed. 
	3. for security group of load balancer configure both listeners https(443) and http(80) to be all inboud traffic should be allowed.
	4. use alb address with both http and https protocol to check if both listeners are working properly.
Naming server updation
	1. copy alb address and add it into cname record of root(moviehacks.in) and cname record for www. 
	2. confirm your website is accessible by visiting website url. (moviehacks.in)
