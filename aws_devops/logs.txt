cloudtrail = cloudtrail records all api calls to all aws services. It is good for auditing purpose.
trail = trail is cloudtrail config which defines which logs in which bucket should be delivered.
below is the example of cloudtrail log file name
AccountID_CloudTrail_RegionName_YYYYMMDDTHHmmZ_UniqueString.FileNameFormat 
e.g. 111122223333_CloudTrail_us-east-2_20150801T0210Z_Mu0KsOhtH1ar15ZZ.json.gz 

cloudtrail log file integrity = when you enable log file integrity for cloudtrail then cloudtrail creates a hash for every file delivered. every hour cloudtrail delivers a file that references the log file for last hour and contains hash of each. This file is called digest file.

kinesis = managed alternative to apache kafka. real time streaming capacity. good for app logs, metrics and iot clickstreams.
kinesis streams = low latency streams ingest at scale. streams are divided into shards or partitions. data retention in streams is 1 day by default. It can go upto 7 days. It has ability to reprocess/replay the data. multiple apps can consume from same stream. Once data inserted into kineisis it can't be deleted.
kinesis stream records have following part in given sequence.
1. data blob
2. record key
3. sequence number
kinesis streams are real-time while kinesis data firehose is near real time.
kinesis analytics = perform real time analytics on stream using sql.
kinesis data firehose = load streams into s3, redshift and es.

cloudwatch metrics
in ec2 we will not get ram usage. that has to be custom metrics. also disk read and write are only applicable to instance store.
in ebs we will get disk read and write. also free space metric has to be custom.

cloudwatch alarms
you cannot combine alarms in cloudwatch alarms. alarm only supports ec2, asg or sns notification target. billing alarm stored in us-east-1(N. Virginia). cloudwatch unified agents provides both metrics and logs.
